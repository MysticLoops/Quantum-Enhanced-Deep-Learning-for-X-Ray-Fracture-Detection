# Quantum-Enhanced-Deep-Learning-for-X-Ray-Fracture-Detection
This study introduced a compact and effective quantum-inspired deep learning framework  for automated fracture detection in musculoskeletal X-rays.   
● Enhances fine fracture edges through FRQI + QHED  
● Maintains efficiency using a lightweight ResNet-18 backbone   
● Two-phase training improves stability and reduces overfitting
