# Quantum-Enhanced-Deep-Learning-for-X-Ray-Fracture-Detection
This study introduced a compact and effective quantum-inspired deep learning framework  for automated fracture detection in musculoskeletal X-rays.   ● Enhances fine fracture edges through FRQI + QHED    ● Maintains efficiency using a lightweight ResNet-18 backbone    ● Two-phase training improves stability and reduces overfitting
